# Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O' (the letter O), capture all regions surrounded by 'X'.
#
# A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.
#
# For example,
# X X X X
# X O O X
# X X O X
# X O X X
# After running your function, the board should be:
#
# X X X X
# X X X X
# X X X X
# X O X X
